== 2.4.  Description of Intern Department
#v(15pt, weak: true)
During my internship at F1Soft International Pvt. Ltd., I was placed in the dynamic DevOps department, which plays a crucial role in the company’s IT infrastructure and operations. The DevOps team is responsible for ensuring seamless integration and deployment processes, enabling continuous delivery and integration (CI/CD) of applications. This involves managing infrastructure automation, monitoring system performance, and enhancing deployment efficiency through streamlined processes and tools. Each team within the department is led by a dedicated team lead who oversees operations and delegates responsibilities to team members. Under the guidance of System Support and Deployment Department, the department fosters a collaborative and energetic environment that enables its teams to deliver exceptional results.

As a DevOps intern, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of my mentors, Sagar Khatiwada and Avash Shakya who provided invaluable assistance throughout my tenure. My responsibilities included assisting in the setup and maintenance of CI/CD pipelines, working with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible for infrastructure automation, and implementing monitoring tools to track system performance. Additionally, I wrote scripts to automate routine tasks, improving overall efficiency in deployment and maintenance processes. This hands-on experience in DevOps practices, coupled with the support and mentorship from my team, significantly enhanced my technical skills and prepared me for a future career in the DevOps field. The collaborative and energetic environment at F1Soft allowed me to develop professionally and contribute effectively to the team's objectives.

== 2.5.  Literature Review
#v(15pt, weak: true)


The adoption of DevOps practices has significantly transformed the software development and IT operations landscape, promoting a culture of collaboration, continuous integration, and automation. DevOps culture thrives on the breaking down of walls between development and operations teams thus enabling faster and more reliable software releases @book:DevOpsPerspective. This kind of transformation is supported by a shift towards this culture which is fostered by processes and tools of automation where quality can be delivered at speed without sacrificing stability of operations or efficiency in running such systems within an organization.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is one such central pillar among other things that make up DevOps @humble2010continuous. CI/CD pipelines automate integration testing deployment, speeding up production cycles through reduction of manual labour errors and general slowness associated with them thus ultimately boosting overall productivity levels within development teams. Also, it sets a ground for receiving quick responses from clients during different stages (feedback loops) because developers can detect any problem at an early stage before proceeding further.

Additionally, you will note that if we put in place DevOps practices then system monitoring and incident management become easier than ever before. There are continuous monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) among others which offer visibility into the performance and health status of a system real time @paper:DevopsEbert/*https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/MS.2016.68*/. Through them organizations can easily find anomalies proactively as well as respond quickly when incidents occur so as to improve reliability while reducing downtime for those depending on these systems most times in businesses world wide. More still, an effective monitoring combined with logging forms strong pillars towards achieving success through ensuring high availability levels & performances are maintained always within any given environment setting under consideration taking cognizance that downtime may translate into huge losses especially financially or even worse loss of lives due failure deliver mission critical services.

/*
Continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) is one of the main components of DevOps. As highlighted by @humble2010continuous, CI/CD pipelines automate integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications into production environments. Less manual intervention means less errors will be made which can be corrected during the delivery cycle that is sped up thus improving overall productivity among development teams. Additionally, these practices enable quick feedback loops where developers may notice problems at an early stage in their development before they become widespread.



According to @morisIAC's explanation, Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) represents another fundamental part of DevOps. He defines this as managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. By doing so one ensures setup for infrastructure is uniform each time its done which cannot happen if done manually therefore there will be no configuration drift since everything has been put under version control too so as well as making sure systems are reliable. Moreover, such tools like Ansible; Terraform; Chef etc., allow complex deployments automation leading to increased operational efficiency.



In conclusion, numerous scholars along with industry professionals underscore how much DevOps has changed both software development and information technology operations (IT Ops). @book:DevOpsPerspective observed that this is accomplished by creating an atmosphere where different groups collaborate on projects; automating many tasks within project management so they require less manual intervention thus saving time as well as effort but still delivering greater results; integrating security measures throughout all stages of the development lifecycle thereby enabling early detection and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities hence reducing chances for any breach occurring at later stages too.
