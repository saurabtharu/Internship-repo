#v(15pt, weak: true)
/*
Even though I had been a DevOps Engineer during my internship at F1Soft International, I was taught all the concepts and practices of DevOps since the responsibilities that were entrusted to me were quite many. 
The following are some of the duties I was required to undertake:
#set enum(numbering: "i)")
+ *CI/CD Pipeline Implementation*:  This involved setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that automate software building, testing, and deployment processes.  Jenkins CI/CD was among the tools I had to configure for this purpose.


+ *Infrastructure Management*:  I had to create and deploy scalable infrastructure solutions using bare-metal servers.  Additionally, I was supposed to set up servers, manage networks as well as storage systems.

+ *Monitoring and Alerting*:  My role also included implementing monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Uptime-Kuma to ensure system reliability and performance.  On top of this I was expected to put in place alerting mechanisms that would help us identify incidents as soon as they occur.

// + *Security Enhancements*:  I integrated security best practices into the CI/CD pipelines while at the same time making sure that our infrastructure met industry security standards.  To do this, I configured firewalls, enforced SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication channels and managed access controls.

+ *Containerization*:  Employing Docker for application containerization; this entailed setting up docker containers and registries as well as their management.  I also participated in deploying containerized applications using Kubernetes (K3s) and managing these clusters through Rancher.

+ *Automation and Scripting*: Writing and maintaining Bash scripts to automate tasks which happen again and again for example deployments; backups and system monitoring.

+ *Documentation and Reporting*: Creating a well-detailed documentation for all processes carried out during the attachment period such configurations done thus changes made. In addition to this I was involved in generating reports on how reliable or efficient our systems were performing.

While working as a DevOps Engineer intern for F1Soft International, my main focus was on bringing together software development and IT operations. I had the following tasks:
#set enum(numbering: "i)")


+ *CI/CD Pipeline Implementation*: \ I automated software build, test, and deployment processes by setting up Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.

+ *Infrastructure Management*: \ I designed infrastructure solutions that could be scaled using physical servers.

+ *Monitoring and Alerting*: \ To ensure system reliability and performance, I implemented monitoring tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, Uptime Kuma as well as set up alerting systems.

+ *Containerization*: \ I utilized Kubernetes (K3s) for managing Docker containers which were orchestrated using Rancher.

+ *Automation and Scripting*: \ My duties also involved writing Bash scripts that would automate routine tasks like deployment processesâ€™ execution or system checks for anomalies detection.

+ *Documentation & Reporting*: \ I kept records of every procedure undertaken along with their configurations before finally compiling performance reports at the end of each month.

+ *Collaboration*: \ Additionally, I worked hand in hand with developers, sysadmins and other team players so as to smoothen integration points between development and deployment workflows

+ *Continuous learning*: \ Staying updated with industry trends and applying new knowledge to improve existing systems.

// + *Security Enhancements*: \ I enforced CI/CD pipeline security measures while making sure our setup met industry standard security requirements which included configuring firewalls or SSL/TLS implementation among others.


DevOps skills development through practical experience gained while performing these duties.

While working at F1Soft International as a DevOps Engineer intern, I concentrated mainly on bridging the gap between software development and IT operations. I had to work in different facets which were very crucial in this activity aimed at making certain processes are not only simplified but also automated for efficiency purposes. My primary obligation lay with creating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins; however, my undertakings did not end there. 



In addition, I was also deeply involved into managing infrastructure. I made sure that any physical servers put in place had ability to accommodate larger loads without compromising on their performance levels thus coming up with scalable infrastructure solutions. This meant setting up servers, networks and storage systems capable of supporting a growing number of users for an organization while maintaining high speed connectivity among others. 



Monitoring along with alerting formed another significant part of what I did during that time period when I worked as such a personnel at Firm. Grafana Promethus Uptime Kuma were among monitoring tools implemented by me so far to oversee system's performance and reliability With my hands-on attitude towards things, therefore, it was important for me also to set up alerting systems which would enable quick identification and resolution of any problems hence minimizing downtimes in general while improving overall efficiency at these levels. 



Moreover, containers were not left out in this case. Docker came in handy where I had to containerize different applications before deploying them using Kubernetes (K3s) which were orchestrated through Rancher. As a result, scalability and reliability were enhanced at the same time making updates management much easier than before within the said applications themselves.. 



While during the internship I was involved in writing Bash scripts that helped automate daily tasks such as deployment processes and system checks, I was also documenting all procedures and configurations in details, which were then used compile monthly performance reports. In order for these development and deployment workflows to seamlessly integrate and operate, it was important that there is collaboration between developers, system administrators as well as other team members. At the same time, I kept an eye on what was going on in the industry so as not be left behind by any new trend since knowledge is power and applied every bit of it towards making things better where necessary thus my experience became very practical thereby greatly boosting skills related with DevOps which has in turn made me better placed for upcoming job opportunities within this particular field.
