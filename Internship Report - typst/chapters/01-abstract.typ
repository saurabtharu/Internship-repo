/*
This report provides an overview of my DevOps Engineer internship at F1Soft International, where I was involved in setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines, automating deployment processes and implementing infrastructure solutions using bare-metal servers. During my time there I got to work with Kubernetes (K3s) for container orchestration and deploying applications along with SSL certification provisioning. Furthermore, among other things, I improved system reliability and performance through monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Uptime Kuma as well as focusing on security enhancements within the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure. 


The internship taught me the true meaning of DevOps culture which is automation, collaboration and continuous learning. I worked hand in hand with both the development team and the operations team to ensure that there was a smooth transition between development and deployment workflows. This has been very helpful for me because it has added onto what I had already learnt practically about DevOps practices thereby preparing myself better for any other future employment opportunities within this field.

The report provides an overview of the DevOps Engineer internship at F1Soft International, where involvement included setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines, automating deployment processes, and implementing infrastructure solutions using bare-metal servers. Kubernetes (K3s) was utilized for container orchestration and application deployment along with SSL certification provisioning. Furthermore, system reliability and performance were improved through monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Uptime Kuma within the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure.

The true meaning of DevOps culture, which encompasses automation, collaboration, and continuous learning, was taught during the internship. Collaboration with both the development team and the operations team ensured a smooth transition between development and deployment workflows. This experience has been very helpful because it has built upon previous practical knowledge of DevOps practices, thereby providing better preparation for future employment opportunities within this field.
