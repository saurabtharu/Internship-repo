As wrap up to internship at Khalti Pvt Ltd,looking back on the diverse experiences that have shaped growth as a Python developer and a professional in software development. During this enriching time, I delved deep into Python programming, using its flexibility and power to create strong solutions. From scraping complex data on the web to building RESTful APIs with Django and Django Rest Framework, each task challenged me and helped me improve technically. I focused on writing code that not only worked perfectly but also followed the best practices and standards.

At Khalti Pvt Ltd, teamwork was crucial, regularly discussing our progress in meetings and supported each other. Giving and receiving feedback during code reviews made all better developers.
